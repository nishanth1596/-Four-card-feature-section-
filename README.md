## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned a lot about CSS Grid layout. With every solution, I am able to look at the design more carefully and identify many details I missed in my previous solutions for different challenges. In this solution, I learned how to apply opacity, how to select different layers in Figma to get accurate design details, and how to add box shadows in CSS.

### Continued development

For this project, I worked on responsiveness for desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) only. In the future, I will ensure that this and upcoming challenges are fully responsive across all devices.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Flexbox - This documentation helped me understand Flexbox better.
Google Fonts - I used the Outfit font from Google Fonts to style the text.
